###  Custom, Custom Repeat, Custom Scheduled, Auto-Replies

#### Triggers
Custom commands aka triggers provide frequently requested information in your channel.  

  * `!command add <name> <text>` - Creates an info command (!name) 
  * `!command delete <name>` - Removes info command (!name)
  * `!command restrict <name> <everyone|regulars|mods|owner>` - Sets access level for triggers.

#### Repeat
The repeat command will repeat a custom trigger every X amount of seconds passed. Message difference allows you to prevent spamming an inactive channel. It requires Y amount of messages have passed in the channel since the last iteration of the message. The default is 1 so at least one message will need to have been sent in the channel in order for the repeat to trigger.  

  * `!repeat add <name> <delay in seconds> [message difference]` - Sets a command to repeat.
  * `!repeat delete <name>` - Stops repetition of a command and discards info.
  * `!repeat on|off <name>` - Enables/disables repetition of a command but keeps info.
  * `!repeat list` - Lists commands that will be repeated.

#### Schedule 
Schedule is similar to repeat but is designed to repeat at specific times such as 5pm, hourly (on the hour), semihourly (on 0:30), etc. `pattern` accepts: hourly, semihourly, and [crontab syntax**](http://i.imgur.com/j4t8CcM.png). **Replace spaces in crontab syntax with _ (underscore)**


  * `!schedule add <name> <pattern> [message difference]` - Schedules a command.
  * `!schedule delete <name>` - Removes scheduled command and discards info.
  * `!schedule on/off <name>` - Enables/disables scheduled command but keeps info.
  * `!schedule list` - Lists schedules commands.

Examples:

 * `!schedule add youtube hourly 0` - This will repeat the `!youtube` command every hour on the hour.
 * `!schedule add ip *_*_*_*_* 0` - This will repeat the `!ip` command every minute.
 * `!schedule add texture *_5_*_*_* 0` - This will repeat the `!texture` at 5am every day.

#### Auto-Replies
Autoreplies are like custom triggers but do not require a command to be typed. The bot will check all messages for the specified pattern and reply with the response if found. **Responses have a 30 second cooldown**

 * `!autoreply list` - Lists current autoreplies
 * `!autoreply add [patten] [response]` - Adds an autoreply triggered by \*pattern\* with the desired response. Use * to denote wildcards and _ to denote spaces in the pattern.
 * `!autoreply remove [number]` - Removes the autoreply with that index number. Do !autoreply list for those values.

Example:

`!autoreply add *what*texture* The broadcaster is using Sphax.` will respond with: `The broadcaster is using Sphax.` if a message similar to: `What texture pack is this?` is typed.
